              <p>Starting with "My Name is Emily" feels way to cliche and boring. I could rip somebody else's intro and
                pull a "Hey! E Sauce here!" but I really don't like that either. I guess I'll leave this grumbling as my
                intro. I'm just a lady trying to further her education since I'm not doing a damn thing with my
                Psycology degree. I've worked in IT adjacent jobs or the past few years and I'm ready to actually do some
                real deep level shit.</p>
              <p>I recently moved to Austin but I've lived in the Austin area for the past 8 years. I have two kitties,
                Calcifer and Sofie, named after characters from one of my favorite movies, Howl's Moving Castle. I try to
                spend as much time outside as my laziness will allow. I like to hunt for mushrooms or nice little shady
                spots to read and draw. I also really enjoy playing D&D and video games. Okay, well this has been very
                uncomfortable for me but I really enjoyed this prodject and I'm super excited to start learning
                frameworks!</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>
