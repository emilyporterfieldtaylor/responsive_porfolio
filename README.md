# Portfolio Project

## Recreating my Portfolio using Bootstrap

This project was to take our current portfolio, made with HTML and CSS, and recreate it using bootstrap. It was easier than writing the pure css and html but I found some difficulting in overwriting the bootstrap css. This was a fun project and I definitley learn a lot from it. 


## Usage

## Credits

I would like to give credit to my roommate Tyler, who painstakingly looked over my terrible code and gently guided me to a completed project.
